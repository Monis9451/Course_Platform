        <p className="mb-4">Reparenting is one of the most profound gifts you can give yourself on your healing journey. It's the practise of becoming the loving, attuned parent your inner child needed—and perhaps didn't fully receive.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">When we experience childhood wounds or trauma, parts of us remain stuck at those developmental stages, waiting for the nurturing, protection, or validation they needed. Through reparenting, you learn to offer those unmet needs to yourself.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">This compassionate practise helps you:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Develop a nurturing internal relationship with yourself</li>
          <li>Respond to emotional triggers with compassion instead of criticism</li>
          <li>Meet developmental needs that were overlooked</li>
          <li>Create new neural pathways of self-care and emotional regulation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="font-medium italic">Reparenting isn't about blaming your caregivers—it's about empowering yourself to heal regardless of your past circumstances.</p>

            <p className="text-sm">Start your day by placing a hand on your heart and asking, "How are you feeling today? What do you need?" Listen with curiosity and compassion, then consider how you might meet one need today.</p>

            <p className="text-sm">When you notice strong emotional reactions, pause and ask, "What younger part of me might be activated right now? What did they need then that I can provide now?" Even a moment of this awareness can shift your response.</p>

            <p className="text-sm">Create a physical self-soothing ritual—perhaps wrapping yourself in a soft blanket, placing a hand on your cheek, or gently stroking your arm while saying, "I'm here with you." Physical touch releases oxytocin and creates a sense of safety.</p>
