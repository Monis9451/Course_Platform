        <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Beginning</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Find a comfortable position where you feel supported and at ease. Allow your eyes to close gently or maintain a soft gaze. Take a few deep breaths, feeling your body becoming heavier and more relaxed with each exhale. Notice any tension you're holding and with each breath, invite that tension to soften.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Creating a Safe Space</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Imagine a place—real or imagined—where you feel completely safe and at peace. Notice the details of this space... What do you see around you? What sounds do you hear? Is there a particular scent in the air? Feel the temperature on your skin... Allow this place to become vivid and real in your mind. This is your sacred meeting place.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Meeting Your Inner Child</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">In this safe space, imagine that your inner child—the younger version of you—is going to join you. You might picture yourself at a specific age, or simply hold the intention of connecting with your child self. Notice if an image comes to mind... How old is this child? What are they wearing? What's their expression? If no clear image appears, that's perfectly fine—just sense their presence.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Approaching with Love</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">As your adult self, approach this child with gentleness and love. Move slowly, respecting their boundaries. Let them know you're here now, as the adult who can protect and care for them. You might sit nearby, extend a hand, or open your arms—following what feels right. Notice how your inner child responds to your presence.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Listening with Compassion</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Ask your inner child what they need from you. What have they been wanting to tell you? What do they most need to hear? Listen deeply, without judgment. They might communicate through words, images, sensations, or simply a felt sense. Whatever arises, receive it with openness.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Offering What Was Missing</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">From your wise adult self, offer what this child needed but didn't receive. You might say: "I see you." "You're safe now." "It wasn't your fault." "Your feelings matter." "I'll never leave you." Use the words that feel most healing. You might also offer comfort through your presence, a hug, or simply being with any emotions that arise.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Integration</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">If it feels right, imagine embracing your inner child and bringing them into your heart. Feel their essence merging with yours—their gifts, resilience, and pure qualities becoming integrated into your adult self. Remember that you can visit this child anytime. You are building a relationship that will continue to grow.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Returning</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Begin to bring your awareness back to your physical body. Feel the points of contact with the surface beneath you. Wiggle your fingers and toes. Take a few deeper breaths. When you're ready, gently open your eyes, carrying the connection with your inner child into your day.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-[#bd6334] mb-4">Common Inner Child Healing Experiences</h3>
        
        <p className="mb-4">When people begin connecting with their inner child, they often have one of these experiences:</p>
        
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Strong Emotions Arise</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Many people experience tears, grief, anger, or tenderness when first connecting with their inner child. These emotions often represent feelings that couldn't be fully expressed in childhood. They're a sign of healing—old pain finally being witnessed and released.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Difficulty Visualizing</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Some people can't "see" their inner child clearly or struggle with visualisation. This is often a protective mechanism. Instead of forcing it, try sensing their presence or energy. Trust what comes naturally—whether images, feelings, sensations, or just a knowing.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Inner Child is Distant or Distrustful</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">If your inner child hides, turns away, or seems afraid, this reflects early experiences of betrayal or harm. Don't force connection; instead, respect their boundaries. Say, "I'll be here when you're ready" and practise patience. Trust builds over time with consistent presence.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Unexpected Age Appears</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Sometimes the inner child who shows up is from a different age than expected. This often indicates a time of significant wounding or need. Trust the wisdom of your psyche to bring forward the aspect that most needs healing now.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Multiple Inner Children</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Some people discover they have several inner children at different ages, each with unique needs. This is completely normal and reflects different developmental stages or aspects of your experience. You can work with one at a time or acknowledge all of them.</p>
