      <div className="bg-[#FFF1DC] p-6 rounded-md mb-8">
        <p className="mb-4">When we experience difficult emotions—anger, grief, fear, shame—our natural tendency is often to push them away. This emotional suppression can seem like self-protection in the moment, especially when we've learned that certain feelings aren't safe to express or when we simply feel overwhelmed by their intensity.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">However, what begins as a survival strategy can create significant long-term costs to our wellbeing. Emotions that aren't processed don't simply disappear—they persist in our bodies and minds, requiring energy to keep contained and often emerging in unexpected and disruptive ways.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">In this lesson, we'll explore the physical, mental, and relational costs of emotional suppression, and begin to understand why releasing these held emotions is essential for healing and reclaiming your vital energy.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">Emotional suppression requires physical effort—your body must literally contain what isn't being expressed. This containment creates tangible costs to your physical wellbeing:</p>

            <p className="text-sm">When emotions are suppressed, muscles contract to contain the energy. Over time, this creates:</p>

            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Fear of Being Overwhelmed</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">You may worry that if you allow yourself to feel a suppressed emotion, it will consume you completely.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Remember:</strong> Emotions are like waves—they rise, peak, and eventually subside. Your nervous system is designed to process and move through emotional states, not remain stuck in them.</p>

            <p className="text-sm">You may have learned that certain emotions are "bad," "weak," or "selfish" to express.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Remember:</strong> All emotions serve a purpose and provide valuable information. Emotions themselves are neutral—it's what we do with them that matters.</p>

            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Remember:</strong> Healthy emotional release can be contained and regulated. With practise, you can learn to express emotions in ways that feel safe and manageable.</p>
