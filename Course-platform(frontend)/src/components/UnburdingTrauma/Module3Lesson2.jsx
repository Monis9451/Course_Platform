        <p className="mb-4">The coping mechanisms that helped you survive childhood difficulties often become the very patterns that limit you as an adult. What once protected you may now be preventing authentic connection, joy, and freedom.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">Understanding the link between your early experiences and current struggles removes shame and creates clarity. When you see how your patterns made perfect sense given what you went through, self-compassion naturally emerges.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">Exploring these connections helps you:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Stop blaming yourself for "self-sabotaging" behaviors</li>
          <li>Recognize that many problems began as solutions</li>
          <li>Identify what your patterns are trying to protect you from</li>
