        <p className="mb-4">Body awareness meditation (sometimes called a body scan) is a foundational practice for reconnecting with your physical self after trauma.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">This practice involves systematically bringing attention to different parts of your body, noticing sensations without trying to change them. It helps create a map of your internal landscape and builds your capacity to be present with bodily experience.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">Regular body awareness meditation can help you:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Identify areas of tension, numbness, or disconnection</li>
          <li>Strengthen the neural pathways for interoception (internal body awareness)</li>
          <li>Notice early warning signs of stress or activation</li>
          <li>Develop a more nuanced vocabulary of physical sensations</li>
        </ul>

            <h4 className="font-medium mb-3">Start Where You Are</h4>
            <p className="mb-3">Begin with areas of your body that feel safest and most accessible:</p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
              <li>Many trauma survivors find extremities (hands, feet) easiest to sense</li>
              <li>Areas of chronic tension may be more noticeable than neutral areas</li>
              <li>Some people connect more easily with the front of the body than the back</li>
              <li>If the internal body feels inaccessible, start with points of contact (where body meets chair/floor)</li>

            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
              <li>Move between easier and more challenging areas of your body</li>
              <li>Alternate between body awareness and external focus (sounds, visual anchor)</li>
              <li>Adjust the depth of focus (light touch vs. deep awareness)</li>
              <li>Use grounding resources when needed (breath, hand on heart, etc.)</li>

            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc">
              <li>Notice qualities of sensation (temperature, texture, movement, etc.)</li>
              <li>Avoid interpreting, fixing, or analyzing what you discover</li>
              <li>When thoughts arise about sensations, gently return to direct experience</li>

              <p className="text-sm">Find a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting. If sitting, allow your spine to be tall yet relaxed, with your feet flat on the floor.

              <p className="text-sm">Start by taking three full, deep breaths. With each inhale, notice the sensation of air flowing into your body. With each exhale, feel a natural release and settling. Now allow your breathing to find its natural rhythm—no need to control or change it.</p>

              <p className="text-sm">Bring awareness to the points where your body makes contact with the surface beneath you. Notice the weight, pressure, temperature, or texture at these points of contact. Take a moment to feel grounded by these contact points.</p>

              <ul className="space-y-1 pl-6 list-disc text-sm mt-2">
                <li>Begin by bringing attention to your feet. Notice any sensations in your toes, the soles of your feet, the tops of your feet, and your ankles. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Move awareness up to your lower legs—your calves and shins. Notice any sensations here. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Continue to your knees and thighs, noticing any sensations of temperature, pressure, movement, or stillness. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Bring awareness to your hips and pelvic area. Notice any sensations of contact with the surface beneath you. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Move to your abdomen and lower back. Notice any sensations related to breath, digestion, or the natural rise and fall of your belly. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Bring awareness to your chest and upper back. Notice your heartbeat if you can, and the movement of breath in this area. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Notice your hands and arms—fingers, palms, wrists, forearms, elbows, and upper arms. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Bring awareness to your shoulders and neck, noticing any sensations of tension, release, or neutral feelings. (Pause)</li>
                <li>Finally, bring awareness to your head—your jaw, mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and the top and back of your head. (Pause)</li>

        <p className="mb-4">When beginning a body awareness practice after trauma, you may encounter various experiences. All of these are normal and part of the reconnection process:</p>
        
        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-3">Absence of Sensation</h4>
            <p className="mb-3">Many trauma survivors experience areas of numbness or disconnection:</p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc mb-3">
              <li>Inability to feel certain body parts</li>
              <li>Vague or fuzzy awareness rather than clear sensation</li>
              <li>Feeling like certain areas are "not yours" or "missing"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="text-sm italic">This is a protective response that developed for good reason. Simply noting "I'm not feeling much here right now" is a form of awareness itself. With consistent practice, sensation often gradually returns.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-3">Emotional Responses</h4>
            <p className="mb-3">Body awareness may trigger emotional responses:</p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc mb-3">
              <li>Unexpected feelings arising from specific body areas</li>
              <li>Tears, sadness, anger, or anxiety emerging</li>
              <li>Shifts in emotional state during the practice</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="text-sm italic">Emotions are stored in the body. When we bring attention to an area, we may access emotional content held there. If emotions become overwhelming, return to a resource like breath or a safe body part.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-3">Activation or Restlessness</h4>
            <p className="mb-3">Some may experience increased activation:</p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc mb-3">
              <li>Difficulty remaining still</li>
              <li>Increased heart rate or breathing</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p className="text-sm italic">This is your nervous system signaling that the current practice may be too intense. Try a shorter duration, keep eyes open, incorporate gentle movement, or focus only on safe body parts.</p>

            <h4 className="font-medium mb-3">Unexpected Insights</h4>

            <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc mb-3">
              <li>Memories associated with body sensations</li>
              <li>Recognition of habitual tension patterns</li>
              <li>Awareness of how emotions manifest physically</li>

          <p className="mb-3">Occasionally, body awareness practice may trigger traumatic memories or flashbacks. If this happens:</p>
          
          <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6 list-disc mb-4">
            <li>Immediately open your eyes if they're closed</li>
            <li>Orient to the present by naming things you can see in your environment</li>
            <li>Engage in a grounding technique (hold something cold, count backwards, etc.)</li>
            <li>Remind yourself that you are safe now and the memory is from the past</li>
            <li>If needed, stop the practice and engage in a calming activity</li>
          </ul>
