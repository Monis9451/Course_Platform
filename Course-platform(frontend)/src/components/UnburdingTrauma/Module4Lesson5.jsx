          <div className="text-purple-700 space-y-3">
            <p>
              <strong>Settling In:</strong> Begin by finding a comfortable seated position. Allow your eyes to close gently or soften your gaze downward. Take three deep, cleansing breaths, letting each exhale release any tension you're holding.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Intention Setting:</strong> Set an intention to honor the work you've done in Module 4. You've courageously faced difficult emotions, challenged stuck points, and opened to healing. This meditation is a gift to yourself ‚Äì a moment to appreciate and integrate your growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Grounding:</strong> Feel your body supported by your chair or cushion. Notice the ground beneath you. You are safe in this moment, held by your own courage and the progress you've made.
            </p>

          <div className="text-blue-700 space-y-3">
            <p>
              <strong>Body Awareness:</strong> Bring your attention to your body. Notice how it feels different than when you started Module 4. Perhaps there's more softness, more awareness, or simply a different quality of presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Honoring Your Body:</strong> Your body has held your experiences, your emotions, and your healing. Take a moment to thank your body for its resilience. Place your hands on your heart and feel the steady rhythm that has carried you through all your experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Release and Integration:</strong> As you breathe, imagine any remaining tension, stuck emotions, or old patterns gently dissolving with each exhale. With each inhale, breathe in acceptance, peace, and the wisdom you've gained.

          <div className="text-rose-700 space-y-3">
            <p>
              <strong>Acknowledging Growth:</strong> Think about the emotions you've worked with in this module. Remember how you've learned to feel them, name them, and work with them rather than against them. This is profound growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Stuck Points Transformation:</strong> Recall the stuck points you've identified and challenged. See them not as failures or weaknesses, but as protective mechanisms that once served you and are now ready to evolve.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Emotional Wisdom:</strong> Your emotions are now more like trusted advisors rather than overwhelming forces. Feel into this new relationship with your inner world. Notice the increased capacity you have for emotional complexity and nuance.

            <p>
              <strong>Meeting Your Future Self:</strong> Imagine yourself six months from now, having continued this healing journey. See this future version of yourself ‚Äì more integrated, more whole, more at peace with your story.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Receiving Wisdom:</strong> What would this future self want to tell you about the work you're doing now? Perhaps they offer encouragement, perspective, or simply a knowing smile that says "you're exactly where you need to be."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Carrying Forward:</strong> Feel the connection between who you are now and who you're becoming. The bridge between these selves is built from the courage, compassion, and commitment you're showing up with each day.

            <p>
              <strong>Gratitude:</strong> Take a moment to feel genuine gratitude for yourself. For your willingness to feel, to grow, to face what many people spend lifetimes avoiding. This courage is extraordinary.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Integration Commitment:</strong> Make a gentle commitment to carry the insights and growth from Module 4 forward into your daily life. Not as pressure, but as a loving reminder of your capacity for healing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Return:</strong> Begin to wiggle your fingers and toes, take a few deeper breaths, and when you're ready, gently open your eyes. You might want to journal about any insights or feelings that arose during this practice.

            Integration is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. The work you've done in Module 4 has created new neural pathways, emotional capacities, and ways of being in the world. Trust that this integration will continue to unfold naturally as you move through your life.

            Remember that healing is not linear. You may have days when old patterns resurface or stuck points feel "stuck" again. This doesn't mean you're going backward ‚Äì it means you're human, and growth includes cycles of expansion and integration.

          <p>
            You've built a foundation of emotional awareness, trauma understanding, and cognitive flexibility that will serve you throughout your life. Trust in your capacity to continue growing, healing, and becoming more fully yourself.
