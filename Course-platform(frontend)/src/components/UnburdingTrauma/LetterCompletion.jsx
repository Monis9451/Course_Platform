                             Trauma work is not linear, and healing is not something that can be measured by how much 
                            you’ve done or how “together” you feel. What matters is that you engaged. That you were 
                            willing, at some point in this process, to look inward - to feel, reflect, or simply stay present 
                            for a little longer than usual.

                             Whether you completed every lesson or moved through just one or two sections, your effort 
                            deserves recognition. This kind of work often happens quietly, and the progress can be subtle 
                            but it is real.

                            You may feel lighter. Or heavier. You might feel more connected, or more aware of what still 
                            needs attention. All of that is part of healing. The fact that you are more in touch with your 
                            experience is itself a sign of movement.

                            Healing doesn’t mean the past disappears. It means that what once held power over you 
                            begins to soften. It means your nervous system learns that it’s allowed to rest. It means your 
                            story no longer has to stay frozen in the body.

                            You’ve taken a meaningful step - one that can be built on, slowly, sustainably, and in your
