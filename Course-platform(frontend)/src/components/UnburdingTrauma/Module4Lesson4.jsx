        <p className="mb-4">Creating alternative beliefs intellectually is just the first step—the real transformation happens when these new beliefs become embodied in your nervous system and daily life.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">Visualisation is a powerful tool for this embodiment process. By imagining yourself living from your new beliefs, you create neural pathways that make these beliefs more accessible and natural over time.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">Embodying new beliefs through visualisation helps you:</p>

            <p className="mb-3">When you vividly imagine an experience, your brain activates many of the same neural circuits that would fire during the actual experience.</p>

        <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 p-5 rounded-lg mb-6 space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Preparation</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Before beginning, select one alternative belief you want to embody more fully. Write it down or hold it clearly in your mind. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won't be disturbed for about 15 minutes. Sit or lie down in a position that allows your body to fully relax.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Centering (2-3 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Close your eyes or soften your gaze. Take several deep breaths, allowing your body to relax more deeply with each exhale. Feel the points of contact between your body and the surface beneath you. Notice any areas of tension and invite them to soften. Allow your awareness to rest inside your body.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Embodying Your Current Belief (3-4 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Gently bring to mind the old belief you wish to transform. Notice how this belief feels in your body. Where do you feel it? What sensations arise? Perhaps tension, heaviness, constriction, or other physical responses. Don't try to change anything—simply observe with curiosity. Notice how this belief affects your posture, breathing, and energy level. Acknowledge that this belief developed for good reasons and has been trying to protect you in some way.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Transition (1-2 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Now, imagine that you're ready to set down this old belief—not forcing it away, but simply creating space for something new to emerge alongside it. Take a few deep breaths, and with each exhale, imagine releasing some of the hold this belief has had on you. Feel yourself becoming lighter and more open.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Embodying Your New Belief (5-6 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Bring to mind your alternative belief. Say it silently to yourself several times. Now, imagine what it would feel like in your body if this belief were completely true for you. How would you hold yourself? How would your breathing change? What sensations might you experience? Allow your body to naturally shift into this new state.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2">Imagine yourself moving through the world with this new belief fully integrated. See yourself in different situations—at home, with loved ones, at work, in challenging circumstances. How do you respond differently? How do others respond to you? Notice the emotional tone of these experiences. Allow yourself to fully feel what becomes possible when you embody this new belief.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Creating an Anchor (2-3 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">While experiencing the felt sense of your new belief, create a physical anchor that you can use to recall this state. This might be:</p>
            <ul className="space-y-1 pl-5 list-disc text-sm mt-2">
              <li>A specific hand position (lightly touching thumb and finger together)</li>
              <li>A particular phrase paired with a deep breath</li>
              <li>A gentle touch to your heart, shoulder, or another part of your body</li>
              <li>A specific image or colour you associate with this new state</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2">Practice using this anchor while fully experiencing the embodied state of your new belief. This creates a neurological connection that will help you access this state more easily in daily life.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Integration and Closing (1-2 minutes)</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Remind yourself that this new belief is available to you at any time, and each time you practise accessing it, the neural pathways become stronger. Begin to bring gentle movement back to your body—perhaps wiggling your fingers and toes, taking a deeper breath, or stretching slightly. When you're ready, slowly open your eyes, carrying the embodied sense of your new belief with you as you return to your day.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">If you encounter difficulties with visualisation, you're not alone. Many trauma survivors find visualisation challenging for various reasons. Here are some common challenges and adaptations:</p>
        
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Difficulty Visualizing Images</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Some people don't naturally think in pictures or may find visualisation triggers dissociation.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Focus on body sensations, emotions, or even concepts rather than visual images. The felt sense of the belief is more important than seeing clear pictures.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Persistent Intrusive Images</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Traumatic imagery may intrude when you try to visualize positive scenarios.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Acknowledge these images without judgment, then gently redirect your focus. You might imagine placing intrusive images in a container or turning down their intensity before returning to your practise.</p>

          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-md border border-gray-200">
            <h4 className="font-medium mb-2">Physical Discomfort</h4>
            <p className="text-sm">Embodying new beliefs may bring up physical discomfort as your system adjusts.</p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-2 italic"><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Start with brief practices and build duration gradually. Include grounding elements like feeling your feet on the floor throughout the practise.</p>
