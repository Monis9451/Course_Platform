      <div className="bg-[#f7f1e9] p-6 rounded-md mb-8">
        <p className="mb-4">Self-compassion is the practise of treating yourself with the same kindness, concern, and support you'd offer to a good friend. Yet for many of us, especially those with trauma histories, self-compassion doesn't come naturally. We need to deliberately cultivate it through consistent practise.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">Creating a regular self-compassion ritual helps rewire neural pathways that may be tuned toward self-criticism, making compassionate self-treatment more automatic over time.</p>
        
        <p className="mb-3">A consistent self-compassion practise helps you:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Respond to difficult emotions with kindness rather than judgment</li>
          <li>Develop emotional resilience during challenging times</li>
          <li>Connect with your common humanity rather than feeling isolated</li>
          <li>Create a sustainable foundation for your healing journey</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p className="font-medium italic">Self-compassion isn't self-indulgenceâ€”it's a courageous form of self-care that research shows reduces anxiety, depression, and shame while increasing wellbeing.</p>
